Hey everyone! I'm super excited to show you my another project - a ToDo list!

This is my fifth website, and I'm really proud of how it turned out.

You can check it out here: https://learnmore-smart.github.io/Stop-Watch/

Hereâ€™s some cool stuff I learned and included:

I found a way to save your list even when you refresh the page, so no more lost tasks!

I also gave it a modern look, with all the delete buttons on the right side and rounded corners for a smooth feel.

Plus, I added some motivational messages when you add a task, to keep you pumped up and inspired!

I hope you find it helpful for staying on top of your daily tasks and long-term goals.

Enjoy~
